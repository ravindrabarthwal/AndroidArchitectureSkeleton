# Android Architecture Skeleton App

This is a skeleton app that follows android MVVM architecture. I have created this app so that I can create a new app without creating packages and structures again and again. I have also included some of the common libraries that I use throughout my app development.

## Dependencies
1. Support Library
2. Support Design Library
3. Android Architecture Components (ViewModel, LiveData and Room)
4. Dagger 2
5. Retrofit
6. Retrofit Converter Gson
7. GSON
8. Glide
9. Timber
10. Data Binding and Java 8 support


Feel free to clone the repository and use this as the starting point for your android app that follows MVVM architecture. Remove non-required dependencies.
